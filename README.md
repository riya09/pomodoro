# pomodoro

Pomodoro technique is a way of achieving a task by concentrating on it for a specific time without any distraction and then taking a small break. The procedure is then repeated. In this project I have built a timer for following pomodoro technique. As soon as someone finishes a task or completes a break, a notification and sound is fired. The code for this project has been written in vanilla JavaScript.
